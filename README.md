# ulab

`ulab` is a `numpy`-like array manipulation library for [micropython](http://micropython.org/) and [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).
The module is written in C, defines compact containers for numerical data of one to four
dimensions, and is fast. The library is a software-only standard `micropython` user module,
i.e., it has no hardware dependencies, and can be compiled for any platform.
The `float` implementation of `micropython` (`float`, or `double`) is automatically detected.

# Supported functions


## ndarray

`ulab` implements `numpy`'s `ndarray` with the `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `**`,
`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=` binary operators, and the `len`, `~`, `-`, `+`, `abs` unary operators that
operate element-wise. Type-aware `ndarray`s can be initialised from any `micropython` iterable, lists of
iterables via the `array` constructor, or by means of the `arange`, `concatenate`, `diag`, `eye`,
`frombuffer`, `full`, `linspace`, `logspace`, `ones`, or `zeros`  functions.

`ndarray`s can be iterated on, and have a number of their own methods, such as `flatten`, `itemsize`, `reshape`,
`shape`, `size`, `strides`, `tobytes`, and `transpose`.


# Customising the firmware

In addition to the `ndarray` operators and methods, `ulab` defines a great number of functions that can
take `ndarray`s or `micropython` iterables as their arguments. Most of the functions have been ported from
`numpy`, but several are re-implementations of `scipy` features. In addition, the `utils` module adds functions that
interface `ndarray`s with peripheral devices. For a complete list, see
[micropython-ulab](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest)!

If flash space is a concern, unnecessary functions can be excluded from the compiled firmware with
pre-processor switches. In addition, `ulab` also has options for trading execution speed for firmware size.
A thorough discussion on how the firmware can be customised can be found in the
[corresponding section](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ulab-intro.html#customising-the-firmware)
of the user manual.

It is also possible to extend the library with arbitrary user-defined functions operating on numerical arrays, and add them to the namespace, as explaind in the   [programming manual](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ulab-programming.html).


# Usage

`ulab` sports a `numpy/scipy`-compatible interface, which makes porting of `CPython` code straightforward. The following
snippet should run equally well in `micropython`, or on a PC.

```python
try:
    from ulab import numpy
    from ulab import scipy
except ImportError:
    import numpy
    import scipy.special

x = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
scipy.special.erf(x)
```

# Finding help

Documentation can be found on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) under
[micropython-ulab](https://micropython-ulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest),
as well as at [circuitpython-ulab](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/ulab/__init__.html).
A number of practical examples are listed in Jeff Epler's excellent
[circuitpython-ulab](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython/overview) overview.

# Benchmarks

Representative numbers on performance can be found under [ulab samples](https://github.com/thiagofe/ulab_samples).

# Firmware

Compiled firmware for many hardware platforms can be downloaded from Roberto Colistete's
gitlab repository: for the [pyboard](https://gitlab.com/rcolistete/micropython-samples/-/tree/master/Pyboard/Firmware/), and
for [ESP8266](https://gitlab.com/rcolistete/micropython-samples/-/tree/master/ESP8266/Firmware).
Since a number of features can be set in the firmware (threading, support for SD card, LEDs, user switch etc.), and it is
impossible to create something that suits everyone, these releases should only be used for
quick testing of `ulab`. Otherwise, compilation from the source is required with
the appropriate settings, which are usually defined in the `mpconfigboard.h` file of the port
in question.

`ulab` is also included in the following compiled `micropython` variants and derivatives:

1. `CircuitPython` for SAMD51 and nRF microcontrollers https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython
1. `MicroPython for K210` https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_K210_LoBo
1. `MaixPy` https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy
1. `OpenMV` https://github.com/openmv/openmv
1. `pycom` https://pycom.io/

## Compiling

If you want to try the latest version of `ulab` on `micropython` or one of its forks, the firmware can be compiled
from the source by following these steps:

### UNIX port

Simply clone the `ulab` repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab.git ulab
```
and then run

```bash
./build.sh
```
This command will clone `micropython`, and build the `unix` port automatically, as well as run the test scripts. If you want an interactive `unix` session, you can launch it in

```bash
ulab/micropython/ports/unix
```

### STM-based boards

First, you have to clone the `micropython` repository by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
```
on the command line. This will create a new repository with the name `micropython`. Staying there, clone the `ulab` repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab.git ulab
```
If you don't have the cross-compiler installed, your might want to do that now, for instance on Linux by executing

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

If this step was successful, you can try to run the `make` command in the port's directory as

```bash
make BOARD=PYBV11 USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab all
```
which will prepare the firmware for pyboard.v.11. Similarly,

```bash
make BOARD=PYBD_SF6 USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab all
```
will compile for the SF6 member of the PYBD series. If your target is `unix`, you don't need to specify the `BOARD` parameter.

Provided that you managed to compile the firmware, you would upload that by running either

```bash
dfu-util --alt 0 -D firmware.dfu
```
or

```bash
python pydfu.py -u firmware.dfu
```

In case you got stuck somewhere in the process, a bit more detailed instructions can be found under https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Getting-Started, and https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Pyboard-Firmware-Update.


### ESP32-based boards

First, clone `ulab` with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab.git ulab
```

and then, in the same directory, `micropython`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
```

At this point, you should have `ulab`, and `micropython` side by side.

With version 1.14, `micropython` switched to `cmake` on the `ESP32` port, thus breaking compatibility with user modules. `ulab` can, however, still be compiled with version 1.14. You can check out a particular version by pinning the release tag as

```bash

cd ./micropython/
git checkout tags/v1.14

```
Next, update the submodules,

```bash
git submodule update --init
cd ./mpy-cross && make # build cross-compiler (required)
cd ..
```
and find the ESP commit hash

```bash
cd ./micropython/ports/esp32
make ESPIDF= # will display supported ESP-IDF commit hashes
# output should look like: """
# ...
# Supported git hash (v3.3): 9e70825d1e1cbf7988cf36981774300066580ea7
# Supported git hash (v4.0) (experimental): 4c81978a3e2220674a432a588292a4c860eef27b
cd ../../
```

Choose an ESPIDF version from one of the options printed by the previous command:

```bash
ESPIDF_VER=9e70825d1e1cbf7988cf36981774300066580ea7
```

In the `micropython` directory, create a new directory with
```bash
mkdir esp32
```
Your `micropython` directory should now look like

```bash
ls
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    CONTRIBUTING.md  esp32     lib      mpy-cross  README.md
CODECONVENTIONS.md  docs             examples  LICENSE  ports      tests
CODEOFCONDUCT.md    drivers          extmod    logo     py         tools
```

In `./micropython/esp32`, download the software development kit with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf
cd ./esp-idf
git checkout $ESPIDF_VER
git submodule update --init --recursive # get idf submodules
sudo -H pip install -r ./requirements.txt # install python reqs
```

Next, still staying in `./micropython/eps32/esd-idf/`, install the ESP32 compiler. If using an ESP-IDF version >= 4.x (chosen by `$ESPIDF_VER` above), this can be done by running `. $BUILD_DIR/esp-idf/install.sh`. Otherwise, for version 3.x, run the following commands in in `.micropython/esp32/esp-idf`:

```bash
# for 64 bit linux
curl https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvz

# for 32 bit
# curl https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux32-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvz

# don't worry about adding to path; we'll specify that later

# also, see https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.2/get-started for more info
```

Finally, build the firmware:

```bash
cd ../../../
cd ./micropython/ports/esp32
# temporarily add esp32 compiler to path
export PATH=../../esp32/esp-idf/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:$PATH
export ESPIDF=../../esp32/esp-idf# req'd by Makefile
export BOARD=GENERIC # options are dirs in ./boards
export USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab # include ulab in firmware

make submodules & make all
```

If it compiles without error, you can plug in your ESP32 via USB and then flash it with:

```bash
make erase && make deploy
```
### RP2-based Port

Building `micropython` with `ulab` currently requires Pimoroni's [micropython fork](https://github.com/pimoroni/micropython/tree/continuous-integration).

Once the pull request for this fork is resolved you should be able to use the official repository. To get started, run the commands below.

First, clone the micropython fork and checkout the `continous-integration` branch.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pimoroni/micropython.git micropython
cd micropython
git checkout continuous-integration
```

Then, setup the required submodules.
```bash
git submodule update --init lib/tinyusb
git submodule update --init lib/pico-sdk
cd lib/pico-sdk
git submodule update --init lib/tinyusb
```

You'll also need to compile `mpy-cross`.
```bash
cd ../../mpy-cross
make
```

That's all you need to do for the `micropython` repository. Now, let us clone the fork of `ulab` (in a directory outside the micropython repository).
```bash
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab ulab
```

With this setup, we can now build the firmware. Back in the `micropython` repository, use these commands:

```bash
cd ports/rp2
make USER_C_MODULE=/path/to/ulab/code
```
If `micropython` and `ulab` were in the same folder on the computer, you can set `USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab/code`. The compiled firmware will be placed in `micropython/ports/rp2/build`.


# Issues, contributing, and testing

If you find a problem with the code, please, raise an [issue](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues)! An issue should address a single problem, and should contain a minimal code snippet that demonstrates the difference from the expected behaviour. Reducing a problem to the bare minimum significantly increases the chances of a quick fix.

Feature requests (porting a particular function from `numpy` or `scipy`) should also be posted at [ulab issue](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues).

Contributions of any kind are always welcome. If you feel like adding to the code, you can simply issue a pull request. If you do so, please, try to adhere to `micropython`'s [coding conventions](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/CODECONVENTIONS.md#c-code-conventions).

However, you can also contribute to the documentation (preferably via the [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/master/docs), or improve the [tests](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/master/tests).

## Testing

If you decide to lend a hand with testing, here are the steps:

1. Write a test script that checks a particular function, or a set of related functions!
1. Drop this script in one of the folders in [ulab tests](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/master/tests)!
1. Run the [./build.sh](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/blob/master/build.sh) script in the root directory of `ulab`! This will clone the latest `micropython`, compile the firmware for `unix`, execute all scripts in the `ulab/tests`, and compare the results to those in the expected results files, which are also in `ulab/tests`, and have an extension `.exp`. In case you have a new snippet, i.e., you have no expected results file, or if the results differ from those in the expected file, a new expected file will be generated in the root directory. You should inspect the contents of this file, and if they are satisfactory, then the file can be moved to the `ulab/tests` folder, alongside your snippet.
